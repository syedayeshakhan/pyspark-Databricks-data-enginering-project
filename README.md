# Building a Data-Driven Hotel Analysis Framework with PySpark and Databricks

This project utilizes PySpark on the Databricks platform to perform comprehensive data engineering and analysis of hotel sales and menu data. By leveraging the power of distributed computing and data processing, this project aims to transform raw data into actionable insights for the hospitality industry.

## Key Features

#### Data Upload and Management:
CSV data files were uploaded to Databricks DBFS for secure storage and easy access.

#### Schema Definition:
 Proper schemas were established using PySpark data types to ensure the accuracy and integrity of menu and sales data.
#### Data Enrichment:
 Temporal data columns such as month, year, and quarter were added to facilitate time-based analysis.
#### KPI Development:
 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were defined and calculated to measure and track critical business metrics.
#### Data Integration:
 Sales and menu data were joined using PySpark for a unified view, enabling deeper insights into sales trends and customer preferences.
#### Data Visualization:
Interactive dashboards and charts were created to visualize the analysis results, providing clear insights into operational performance.

#### This project highlights the application of advanced data engineering techniques and tools to drive data-driven decision-making in the hotel industry.
